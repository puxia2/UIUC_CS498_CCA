1. when adding an IAM role for the crawler, remember to attach policy to the role to make S3 full acess to the crawler;
Do the same when adding an IAM role for the ETL job.

2. ETL: source: S3 target
Transform: select fields
source: S3 bucket

3. save ETL jo results, Athena query results and bucket that contains CSV in different S3 buckets.

4. if your result is an empty table with perhaps 5 more rows in the Athena test, try to make a new crawler and set the data source as
the transfomed S3 results.

5. the way to determine if a CSV is tab-separated or comma-separated is to open the csv with a notepad.
