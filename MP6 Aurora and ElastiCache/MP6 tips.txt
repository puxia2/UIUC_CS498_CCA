1. access Aurora database with MySQL workbench:
in the security group, add a rule with type = "MYSQL/Aurora", port = 3306 and source=ip address

2. in MySQL workbench:
set id to be "INT unsigned NOT NULL" (this is important, otherwise the MAX(id) you get from table will be 9 instead of 25 and the type will be "None")
when loading data from S3, remember to "INGNORE 1 ROWS"
if wanting to delete a row from the table, add this line: "SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;"

3. make sure all in the same VPC(Redis, Aurora, Lambda)

4. create Redis cluster:
cluster mode is "disabled"



5. Connect to Redis with EC2 instance:
sudo yum install gcc
curl -O http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz

cd redis-stable
make distclean  # Ubuntu systems only
make

src/redis-cli -h redis-new-mp6.8rmbia.ng.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com -c -p 6379

6. refer to the link below to install python dependencies in AWS Lambda:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-packages-for-aws-lambda-layers/

7. set up IAM roles for Lambda and attach Lambda to the same vpc in "Configuration" tab.

8. Try reboot the redis node if the grader test fails.
