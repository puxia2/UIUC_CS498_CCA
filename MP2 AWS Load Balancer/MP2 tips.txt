0. two EC2 instances have to be in different Availability Zone or the health check would fail
   (in the subnet part in Networking section)

1. host name in putty: ec2-user@(IPV4-Public-DNS-Name)

2. set port to be 5000 in flask app
   test GET and POST in Chrome Postman
   
3. In Postman when dealing with POST:
   in the "body" section, select "raw", switch "Text" to "JSON"
   enter a JSON object (eg. {"num": 100})


4. process to run flask app after ssh to EC2 instances:
pip3 install virtualenv

mkdir mp2

cd mp2

virtualenv venv

python3 -m virtualenv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip install Flask

###################################
After the above steps, open WinSCP and transfer server files to mp2 folder in two EC2 instances, 
then do the following in putty:

export FLASK_APP=server.py

flask run --host=0.0.0.0


5. target group port set to 5000 (same as flask app)
   load balancer listener remains unchanged (80)
   add EC2 security group to load balancer security group
   make sure putty is still connecting with two EC2 when configuring target group and load balancer
